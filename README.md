# Sustainable HW Dimensioning 

This repo contains the project for the Artificial Intelligence in Industry project for the Master's Degree course in 
Artificial intelligence at UniBo.

## Usage

This project uses the Gurobi solver for Linear Programming, for which a License is needed. In order to run the notebook,
you should first obtain a Web [License Service (WSL)](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/13232844297489-How-do-I-set-up-a-Web-License-Service-WLS-license) 
file from the Gurobi portal, then copy it in the repo. Then launch:

```commandline
sudo docker compose up
```

This will mount the gurobi license as a volume.
