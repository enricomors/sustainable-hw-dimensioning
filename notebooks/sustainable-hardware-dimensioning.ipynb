    "# Sustainable Hardware Dimensioning (AIITI Exam)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we explore the problem of finding the the best Hardware architecture and its Dimensioning for AI algorithms, while respecting constraints in terms of carbon emissions. An existing tool, named [HADA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950705122005974) (HArdware Dimensioning of AI Algorithms)  has focused on the task of Hardware Dimensioning with constraints on budget, runtime and solution quality. We aim at extending this approach by also considering constraints on carbon emissions resulting from computations, and we name this problem Sustainable Hardware Dimensioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The HADA approach is based on the [Empirical Model Learning (EML)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370216000126) paradigm, which integrates Machine Learning (ML) models into an optimisation problem. Broadly speaking, EML deals with solving declarative optimisation models with a complex component $h$, which represents the relation between variables which can be acted upon $x$ (the decision variables) and the *observables* $y$ related to the system considered; the function $h(x) = y$ describes this relationships. As the $h(x)$ is complex, we cannot optimise directly over it. Hence, we exploit empirical knowledge to build a surrogate model $h_\\theta(x)$ learned from data, where $\\theta$ is the parameter vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "HADA is then constituted of three main phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Set Collection** (benchmarking phase): an initial phase to collect the data set by running multiple times the target algorithms, under different configurations of algorithm hyperparameters and Hardware;\n",
    "2. **Surrogate Model Creation**: once a training set is available, a set of ML models is then trained on such data. These are the surrogate models $h_{\\theta}(x)$, which are then encoded in the optimisation problem as a set of variables and constraints following the EML paradigm;\n",
    "3. **Optimisation**: post the user-defined constraints and objective function on top of the combinatorial structure formed by the encoded ML models and the domain-knowledge constraints, and finally solve the optimisation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original HADA work focuses on two stochastic algorithms, i.e., anticipate and contingency [[3]](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/150) from the energy management system domain. The two algorithms calculate the amount of energy that must be produced by the energy system to meet the required load, minimising the total energy cost over the daily time horizon and by taking into account the uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What we will do in this work\n",
    "\n",
    "The code implementing the two algorithms as well as the HADA tool has already been developed. In particular there is a version of HADA implemented as a Flask web application, that given the Data Sets of the target algorithms, it provides a user interface to select the algorithm, specify the obective and the constraints. Then, it creates the ML models under the hood, embeds them in the optimisation model, adds the user-defined constraints and solves the model for the required objective, namely the phases (2) and (3) described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the focus of the current work is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Measure the carbon emissions of the target algorithms, namely anticipate and contingency\n",
    "* Collect new datasets running the algorithms over a set of instances with different configurations and on different HW platforms;\n",
    "* Update the existing HADA code for accomodating carbon emissions."

    "## Measuring Carbon Emissions\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Carbon Emissions** are expressed in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent $\\mathsf{CO_2e}$, and summarise the global warming effect of the Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emitted in the determined timeframe. To measure the Carbon Emissions we rely on [codecarbon](https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/index.html), which is a python package offering useful tools for tracking the emissions resulting from executing code execution. Codecarbon computes the Carbon Emissions ($\\mathsf{C}$) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\mathsf{C} = \\mathsf{E} \\times \\mathsf{CI}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $\\mathsf{E}$ is the Energy consumed by the computational infrastructure, quantified as kilowatt-hours (kWh).\n",
    "* $\\mathsf{CI}$ is the **Carbon Intensity** of the electricity consumed for computation, quantified as g of $\\mathsf{CO_2e}$ emitted per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Codecarbon directly measures the energy consumption of the CPU, GPU and RAM on which the code is executed at intervals of 15 sec (by default, but it can also be modified). For example, let's track the emissions of running the ANTICIPATE algorithm. Let's say we would like to solve instance 5 with 4 scenarios:"

    "**Benchmark on Leonardo**: The process to execute ANTICIPATE and CONTINGENCY on Leonardo presented some challenges. Both algorithms use the [Gurobi solver](https://www.gurobi.com/), and the process of figuring out how to use it was not straightforward, since it was not possible to install a license directly on the compute node where the algorithms would run. Therefore, this phase took quite some time to figure out the right way to proceed, and required the cooperation of CINECA staff and Gurobi's assistance. In the end, the solution was to install an *Academic Floating License* on the CINECA License Server, and use a Client License to connect to the server where the license resides once the solver is run."

    "This anomaly was not present in the data gathered on my machine, so i would have wanted to run new tests on Leonardo to understand the source of the problem. Unfortunately, this occurred in conjunction with the flooding in Emilia Romagna, which caused major problems for CINECA, resulting in the suspension of all HPC services until further notice. It was therefore not possible to replicate the tests on Leonardo. Of course, as soon as the HPC services will be restored, i will start working to solve this issue."

So, by using the offline tracker we can be sure that codecarbon will use the right Energy Mix data. Incorporating this aspects is one of the objectives of the thesis work, as well as including data about Energy Mix for each country directly in HADA, for enabling estimation of the emissions also in different countries without having to repeat the benchmark phase."
